# **Lab Report Part 1**

In this portion of the lab, we will introduce you to Autopsy and conduct
some basic analysis of the files extracted.

Tools:

Product: Autopsy Manufacturer: The Sleuth Kit

Web site: [<u>http://www.sleuthkit.org</u>](http://www.sleuthkit.org/)

> *Note: It is important to use a common time standard when conducting
> an investigation. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is often used as that
> started. Autopsy allows you to standardize time under Tools \> Options
> \> View \> When Displaying Times \> GMT*



> NOTE: After the evidence finishes loading, look at some of the
> date/timestamps shown in Autopsy. Now navigate to Tools, then Options,
> then View. On this screen locate the “When displaying times” setting
> and change from “Local time zone” to “Use another time zone”. Select
> GMT +0:00/Etc/UTC from the list and apply. Now look at your timestamps
> in Autopsy again and see if you notice any changes.
