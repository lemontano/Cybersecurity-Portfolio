# Executive Summary

> This report is going to show you the different phishing and vishing
> attempts being conducted on an employee from the city of XXXXXXXXX.
> The purpose of this is to raise awareness, especially during the
> holiday season. There was a total of three phishing attempts sent out
> which were via email. There were also two vishing attempts made
> towards the target XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Of the three emails sent only
> one of them was clicked. Per the phone calls attempted no one answered
> but two voicemails were left. Making sure that awareness is raised
> during this campaign is crucial to avoid financial ruin and
> embarrassment, especially since the target works in the finance field.

# Phishing

> To simulate the actions of potential attackers, SECOM employs a social
> engineering technique called phishing, or sending unsolicited emails
> to recipients to influence them into clicking an attachment containing
> malware or a malicious link. Most commonly, the link will lead to a
> website that will collect network credentials or load malicious
> software.
>
> The purpose of SECOM phishing emails is twofold. First, SECOM can
> record and analyze employees’ response to a potential attack by
> collecting statistics (including total emails sent, number of
> recipients who clicked a potentially malicious link, number of
> recipients who reported receiving the email, and other data of
> interest).
>
> Second, if recipients click a link in one of the phishing emails, they
> are routed to an internal landing page. This landing page explains how
> they could have identified a specific phish and how their organization
> wishes for them to respond. By repeating this process with the
> population and analyzing the data collected, SECOM can determine the
> effectiveness of training over time.

## Level 1 Phishing Findings

> When developing a PRETEXT for XXXXXXX it was difficult since she was
> very private during my OSINT. The first email I sent was on 11/28/2023
> at 18:28 eastern standard time and the second was on 11/30/2023 21:56
> est. The email contained a PDF screenshot that was labeled Account
> Statement. Since she is a finance clerk, I thought it would be wise to
> have her think I am a customer and want someone to look over my
> statement. The email that used was <leo.dXXXXXXXXX> and sent
> from Leonardo Dominguez to <XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>.
> There was a total of two emails sent under this PRETEXT with two
> different campaigns. There was a total of two clicks under the email
> sent on 11/28/2023. Below Figure 1.1 is going to show the email that
> was sent.

> The first click came from a Chrome 117.5938 browser with IP address
> XXX.XXX.XXX.XX seconds after the email was sent. That IP address came
> back to a CISCO system meaning it was processed and clicked by a
> security system. The second click came a week later 12/04/2023 to a
> private IP address XXX.XXX.XXX.XX meaning that the user clicked on the
> link or image in the email.
>
> Figure 1.2 is the email on 11/28 and 1.3 is the email that was sent on
> 11/30. They are going to show the clicks of each attempt.

## Level 1 Operating Systems Detected

> During these attempts there was only one operating system detected by
> Lucy and that was a Windows system. Figure 2.1 will show what the
> software detected.

## Level 2 Phishing Findings

> For this Phishing attempt I changed the PRETEXT to a delivery from
> FedEx. At first, I was not getting any clicks on the first two
> attempts so I decided to make another PRETEXT. I sent an email from
> Jake Flanagan with the email address
> <jake.flanagan@notifications-fedex.com>. The figure 3.1 will
> demonstrate an example of the phishing email sent.

## Level 2 Operating Systems Detected

> There was no operating detected in this PRETEXT as there were no
> clicks per Lucy.

## Phishing Analysis

> To summarize all the phishing attempts made with the two different
> PRETEXTS only one was clicked and that was days later after being
> sent. There was a total of three emails sent and only one was clicked
> which brings us to a 33.33 percent chance of success. Even though the
> email was sent on the 28<sup>th</sup> of November the click was made a
> week later. Makes you think about what made the target go back and
> click that email.

## Phishing Recommendations

> Overall, the target needs to be aware of the different phishing emails
> being sent. Verifying who the client is and looking in the system
> before any actions are taken, especially when working in the finance
> department. Making sure that a person in this role gets extra training
> is crucial since they are dealing with employee’s paychecks and other
> financial accounts.

# Vishing

> Attackers often elicit information via the telephone, called
> “vishing,” to further develop their attacks. It is important for a
> company to be aware of the amount of information employees provide to
> unconfirmed callers, whether intentionally or not.

## Vishing Findings

> I attempted to make two Vishing attempts to phone number XXXXXXXXXX.
> The first attempt was on 11/27/2023 from Leonardo Dominguez. The phone
> number that was used was XXXXXXXXXX. The second attempt was on
> 11/28/2023 from the same name and number. I left a voicemail on both
> calls. The UID for the two calls are
> c74981f2-12e1-4458-bc24-7caef1bf4330 and
> e8ad74f6-35f4-4e0f-91f3-8eddd1ed7d14.
>
> **SEVERITY**: **LOW**
>
> The following pretext(s) were used during the vishing campaign:

- If the target answered instruct them go to the email that was sent and
  go over the statement in the email.

> The following tables are summaries of employee performance.

## Vishing Recommendations

> The best recommendation that I can give is making sure that you verify
> who is calling by pulling up the name in the system. Ask security
> questions that are in place that way you are not giving out
> information. If the user is not in the system, make sure to have them
> come in person to have that statement reviewed.

# Conclusion

> The overall attempts combined made it possible to for the attack to be
> successful. I left two voicemails, and it makes me wonder if that
> voicemail was heard by the target making her go back and click on that
> statement. The first email was sent back on 11/28 and was not clicked
> on by a private IP address until 12/04. There were other emails sent
> later but those were not clicked. The second PRETEXT that was sent
> about the FedEx delivery was also not clicked which makes me wonder if
> the two voicemails combined to have the user go back to that email
> that was originally sent.
>
> Ensuring that the employee is verifying callers who leave voicemails
> needs to be addressed because if the employee is going back to an old
> email or looking for a client can cause a security issue later in the
> future. Security awareness should be done every 6 months since the
> user deals with sensitive information daily. Should you have any
> questions, require additional reporting data, or wish to discuss
> further, please do not hesitate to contact us directly. The University
> of XXXXXXX looks forward to a continuing partnership with the city of
> XXXXXXXXX.
