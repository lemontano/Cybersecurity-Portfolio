# Executive Summary

> This report provides the results of the DECEMBER 2023 social
> engineering assessment conducted by Social- Engineer, LLC (SECOM) for
> <span class="mark">XXXXXXXXXXXX</span> CITY EMPLOYEES. The purpose of
> this ongoing assessment is to determine COMPANY’s vulnerabilities to
> human-based attacks using phishing, spear phishing, and vishing attack
> vectors.
>
> Particularly on this target <span class="mark">Xxxxxxxxxxxx</span> is
> a police officer who works at a school. I was giving certain
> information about the target, which was the phone number and email
> address. I was able to find out during the open-source intelligence
> phase about what <span class="mark">XXXXX</span> does and where he
> works. There was little information on
> <span class="mark">XXXXX,</span> but I was able to get a PRETEXT to
> try and lure him in. I noticed that <span class="mark">XXXXX</span>
> likes to be a part of fundraisers. I called
> <span class="mark">XXXXX</span> twice but was sent to his voicemail
> and sent a total of three emails. Two of the emails were about a
> fundraiser and the third email was about a FedEx delivery. I decided
> to go with the delivery method since we are in the month of December
> and most people do online shopping.
>
> According to Lucy, which is our phishing software
> <span class="mark">XXXXX</span> did not click on any of the fundraiser
> phishing emails. Unfortunately, <span class="mark">XXXXX</span>
> clicked on the FedEx email from various sources according to our
> software.

# Phishing

> To simulate the actions of potential attackers, SECOM employs a social
> engineering technique called phishing, or sending unsolicited emails
> to recipients to influence them into clicking an attachment containing
> malware or a malicious link. Most commonly, the link will lead to a
> website that will collect network credentials or load malicious
> software.
>
> The purpose of SECOM phishing emails is twofold. First, SECOM can
> record and analyze employees’ response to a potential attack by
> collecting statistics (including total emails sent, number of
> recipients who clicked a potentially malicious link, number of
> recipients who reported receiving the email, and other data of
> interest).
>
> Second, if recipients click a link in one of the phishing emails, they
> are routed to an internal landing page. This landing page explains how
> they could have identified a specific phish and how their organization
> wishes for them to respond. By repeating this process with the
> population and analyzing the data collected, SECOM can determine the
> effectiveness of training over time.

## Level 1 Phishing Findings

> The first phishing email that I sent out to
> <span class="mark">Xxxxxxxxxxxx</span> was about a Fundraiser. There
> was a total of two emails sent from <leo.d@xxxxxxxxxxz.com>. One
> email sent on 11/27/2023 to email address
> [<span class="mark">Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>]GOV).
> Below on Figure 1.1 is what the email looked like. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
>

### Level 1 Operating Systems Detected

> The email was opened via Windows operating system on Chrome 117 from
> IP address of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXminutes after sending. When investigating
> the IP address, I noticed that it had belonged to Cisco. That
> indicated that the email was opened from a security measure standpoint
> and not the user. I had to send another email. I sent another email
> from the same email and PRETEXT but there was no click not even from a
> CISCO server.

## Level 2 Phishing Findings

> For the second Phishing Attempt I decided to go with a notification
> from FedEx. Since we are in the middle of the holiday season, I
> assumed that he could have ordered something online. According to Lucy
> the user clicked on the email eighteen separate times from different
> IP addresses. As shown below on Figure 2.1 you can notice the
> different web browsers and IP addresses. The campaign started on
> 12/05/2023 at 13:06 and the first click registered at 13:27 on
> 12/05/2023.

### Level 2 Operating Systems Detected

> The following operating systems were used to click on the phishing
> email shown on figure 2.2. Windows, IOS, and LINUX. The browsers that
> were used to also click were Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Chrome Mobile IOS,
> and Internet Explorer 10. The figures below are going to show the
> clicks with the different operating systems as well as the number of
> clicks.

## Phishing Recommendations

> Overall, 33.33% of emails that were sent were clicked. 1 of 3 emails
> succeeded. My recommendation for this user is to make sure to verify
> tracking information before clicking a link. Go to the website or
> email that was first originally sent to target when the order was
> placed. Make sure the user is attending or completing annual cyber
> awareness training and let the user know about the different phishing
> spams that are out there especially during the holiday season.

# Vishing

> Attackers often elicit information via the telephone, called
> “vishing,” to further develop their attacks. It is important for a
> company to be aware of the amount of information employees provide to
> unconfirmed callers, whether intentionally or not.

## Vishing Findings

> Attempted to contact Target using different phone numbers. One of the
> phone numbers that was used was XXXXXXXXXXXXfor Leonardo Dominguez.
> Target did not answer the phone and was sent to voicemail. That
> attempt was for fundraiser PRETEXT of the Phishing email. The second
> PRETEXT was for the delivery from FedEx. The phone number that was
> used for this was XXXXXXXXXXXX. I also got a voicemail but this time I
> left a message stating who I was and that a package was being held at
> our location in Xxxxxxxxxxxx. I also mentioned that I sent an email
> and to look for an email from Jake Flanagan. The number that was
> called was XXXXXXXXXXXXX. The UID to the different calls are
> d10c23d3-ae17-4fb7-b745-dc2d9ec1965d and
> ce338cf1-d7c6-49bd-9952-aeaf7c947d23.
>
> **SEVERITY**: **LOW**
>
> The following pretext(s) were used during the vishing campaign:

- Call from Leonardo Domiguez to discuss a fundraiser for Children who
  do not have gifts this season.

- Call from Jake Flanagan to let user know that a FedEx package was
  being held at our Location in Xxxxxxxxxxxx.

## Vishing Analysis

The overall result was that the user did not answer a phone call from an
unrecognized number. I am not sure if the Targets job is to answer phone
calls since he does work at a school and as a Police officer. Could have
not answered since we are in the holiday season and could be on
vacation.

## Vishing Recommendations

> Although the user did not answer the phone and I was sent to
> voicemail. A recommendation I can make is to always verify who is
> calling and make sure to not give out too much information when
> talking over the phone. Always make sure to report the call to the
> CISO if it seems strange or feels strange.

# Conclusion

> These tests are meant to catch the vulnerabilities of humans. The
> phishing and vishing attacks that were performed on the target were
> meant to raise awareness especially during the holiday season. There
> were multiple emails sent out to the target and the one that succeeded
> was the delivery email from FedEx. Target did not answer any calls, so
> I was not able to try and obtain information about other employees or
> the resources within the company. Unfortunately, all you need is just
> one click and by the looks of the third email it was clicked eighteen
> times from multiple operating devices, browsers, including a mobile
> device.
>
> Ensuring the employee is exposed to cyber security awareness is
> crucial to maintain a good healthy environment according to this
> report. The goal of these tests is to make sure that the company
> raises awareness, saves embarrassment, and prevents financial ruin.
> Should you have any questions, require additional reporting data, or
> wish to discuss further, please do not hesitate to contact us
> directly. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX looks forward to a continuing
> partnership with the city of Xxxxxxxxxxxx.
